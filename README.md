## Disclaimer

**THE CODE USED IN THIS REPOSITORY NEEDS MAJOR REFACTORING. THE REASON IS IT WAS WRITTEN LAST MINUTE TO FIX A COMMON PROBLEM.**

**THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES (WILL BE CREATED SOON), INCLUDING ACCESSIBILITY, DUPLICATE CODE, INEFFICIENT LOGIC.**

## Motivation

The MSCC Developers Conference has an awesome agenda that showcases all of its sessions. One issue though is attendees can't save sessions they're interested in attending, which can be an inconvenience at the conference as they need to check the whole agenda just to find out details about the next session.
