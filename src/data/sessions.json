        "description": "JavaScript objects are complex. Perhaps you do not know enough about JavaScript objects. Let us find that in this live coding based talk\r\nPerhaps you do not know enough about JavaScript objects or I do not know enough about JavaScript objects.  Let us settle this debate in this talk. To start with, we will first settle debate on whether JavaScript is an Object Oriented Language or prototype based language. Since, we do not have class (yes in ECMA 6, there is a keyword class syntax introduced but that is not a real class anyway) then how objects are created? \r\nAnswer of all above questions lie in understanding of following concepts, \r\n\u2022\tDifferent ways of JavaScript object creation\r\n\u2022\tprototypes and prototype chain\r\n\u2022\tthis keyword \r\n\u2022\t__proto__\r\nThis session will simplify these truly vital and the most important topics of JavaScript language. As a starter, JavaScript is a prototype based language in which object is linked by another object, and in order to do that it creates a prototype chain. Having a good understanding of prototype is required to write real JavaScript applications or to work effectively with popular JavaScript Frameworks. \r\nThis talk will be combination of live coding and visualization of concepts as drawing on the white board. At the end of the talk, you will have good understanding of following:\r\n1.\tDifferent ways of creating JavaScript objects such as:  Object Literals, Constructor invocation pattern ,Object.Create() method , and using class.\r\n2.\tAbout object property descriptors \r\n3.\tDetermining value of \u2018this\u2019 using different invocation patterns\r\n4.\tBreaking prototype, constructor, and __proto__\r\nHaving good understanding of above concept helps you to write better JavaScript application. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of my most popular talk among developers in India.  Does not matter where I have delivered it, It got good rating. We all just assume that we know JavaScript as a language, but most of the time, we do not. For example,  if foo is a function in JavaScript then what is output of foo.prototype.constructor.prototype.constructor.prototype.__proto__  . Give your audience opportunity to learn mystery of JavaScript through this talk. I explain it on white board like we learnt quadratic equation n school math.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Kubernetes, since its release in 2015, has remained shrouded in mystery, relegated as this cryptic domain to the sorcerers who conversed in the bizarre language of yaml. But what if I told you that it doesn't have to be this way?\r\n\r\nThis session aims at casting some light on the massive complex framework that is Kubernetes, so that you too can shout \"btw i use kubernetes\" with pride. You will finally understand the technical jargon surrounding Kubernetes, as well as how each component works together seamlessly when deploying applications.\r\n\r\nAfter this session, you will be well equipped to embark on a Kubernetes-related adventure of your own, be it as a developer of system administrator.",

Testing, with meticulous scrutiny and validation, emerges as an equally consequential character. Although it can be challenging (more than people often realize), it is the guardian ensuring only reliable, secure and quality code goes live.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this session is to shift developers' perspective on software testing and quality assurance. We will talk about the various types of tests, levels of testing and how to choose the appropriate tests and tools for different projects\/situations.\r\n\r\nAudience: \r\nBoth developers and testers who are curious enough to face their bugs.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n* What are the differences between testing and checking?\r\n* Where does testing fit in?\r\n* Different flavours and levels of testing\r\n* Project-focused test strategies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe level of complexity and ingenuity one can bring to testing rivals the thrill of development, and can be an entire career path in itself if one invests the time to master it.\r\n",

        "description": "Imagine being able to periodically assess the status, availability and performance of your project to output whether it is all operational or if there is a failure. Then, extend that thought from your project to deeper checks on individual nodes and critical services\/logic in it. Wouldn't that be wonderful?\r\n\r\nThere are tools that can help you do that.\r\nBut what if it was inbuilt in the project itself, and even provides fallbacks for your project to self-heal if there is a problem?\r\n\r\nThis session aims to introduce the audience to .NET Health Checks, a nifty little addition to the .NET Framework that can work wonders in diagnostic and monitoring.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n- What are health checks and why are they important?\r\n- What are the types and levels of health checks?\r\n- Health Checks middleware and libraries in .NET\r\n- Customizing the health check response\r\n- Resource utilization health checks\r\n- Visualization of health check information\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges you face when dealing with a customer-focused product is to be as proactive as possible in dealing with production issues. Let's see how close we can get in this session.",

        "description": "Signals are used to achieve fine-grained reactivity. Seeing its growing popularity, Angular has brought Signals as a new feature to achieve Fine-Grained, Glitch-Free Reactivity.  The signal is a new way to inform the template and another part of the codes that data has changed, and also, it will have more on how Change Detection would be propagated in the component tree. In the future, a Signal component would only cause the Change Detector to run only for the component where data has changed instead of the whole component tree. \r\n\r\nSo, what are signals? How would you create, read, and update it? Also, how can a signal and RxJS Observable be used together? This session answers all these questions with a working live coding example. \r\n",
